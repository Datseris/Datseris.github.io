I took a habit of spending a couple of hours every Sunday painting something. After I have a painting done I typically gift it to a friend (as these things accumulate so fast!). I upload my paintings on a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DatsasSPA) (yes I am sorry about that). Here are some examples:

![Spray Painting no. 305](../images/spray/Datsas305.jpg)
![](../images/spray/large.jpg)

![](../images/spray/3.jpg)
![](../images/spray/small.jpg)

The last one is actually a tini-tiny canvas, about as large as your index finger.
