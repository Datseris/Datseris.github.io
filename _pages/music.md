Although my actual profession is physicist, I consider myself a professional drummer. I graduated from Philippos Nakas conservatory (official collaborator of Berkley college of music) in 2015 and since then I haven't stopped practicing and playing live music. My biggest success in music so far is undeniably my band the [Max Funk Institute](https://www.maxfunk.info/).

Since I also do actual research on music, I have developed software that allow me to analyze music easily. I realized that I can use these software to get better on the drums, which I illustrate in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oog_aunpVms). You could use these too!

## Videos
Here are some videos of me playing drums (playalongs/live gigs/etc.)
