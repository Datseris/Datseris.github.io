I develop, perform, and update workshops constantly throughout my career. All material I develop are also hosted online and are available freely under open source licenses. However I also offer performing tailored workshops for consortia upon request. The workshops I develop are:

- [Good Scientific Code](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/GoodScientificCodeWorkshop). An intensive, language-agnostic, module-based-workshop teaches scientist how to write code that is Clear, Easy to understand, Well-documented, Reproducible, Testable, Reliable, Reusable, Extendable, and Generic.
    - One of the modules of this workshop is [an extensive session on documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDQ28X3mGSo) that can be performed as a standalone workshop.
- [Introduction to the Julia programming language (Julia Zero2Hero)](https://github.com/Datseris/Zero2Hero-JuliaWorkshop/tree/main). An intensive full-day workshop for the Julia language programming language. It aims to take someone with prior experience with programming (e.g., a Python user), and teach them everything they need to know to start using Julia like a pro.
- [Computational nonlinear dynamics and complex systems research with JuliaDynamics](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/NonlinearDynamicsComplexSystemsCourse). A whole semester-long workshop/course composed of many different modules teaching how to perform computational research with nonlinear dynamics and complex systems. It utilizes software based on the Julia language and primarily the [JuliaDynamics](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics) software organization.
