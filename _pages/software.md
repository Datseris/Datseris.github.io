I am the lead developer of [JuliaDynamics](https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/) and also involved with [JuliaMusic](https://juliamusic.github.io/JuliaMusic_documentation.jl/dev/) and [JuliaClimate](https://github.com/JuliaClimate).

The software I've spent most of my time on are:

* ClimateBase.jl: a package for intuitive analysis of climate data.
* DynamicalBilliards.jl: an easy-to-use, modular and extendable Julia package for dynamical billiards in two dimensions.
* DynamicalSystems.jl: an award-winning Julia software library for the exploration of chaos and nonlinear dynamics.
* ComplexityMeasures.jl: Data analysis through the lens of complex systems.
* DrWatson: A software package created to help scientists manage their scientific projects!
* Agents.jl: Flexible, future-full and easy to use Agent-based-modelling framework for Julia.
* MIDI.jl: Software for reading and writing MIDI data with Julia. Also offers specialized structures for music notes.
* MusicManipulations.jl: advanced functionality about note processing, data extraction, quantizing and other similar processes that related to music data.
