Software I have either developed myself or I have contributed to significantly are found in the websites of the GitHub organizations JuliaMusic and JuliaDynamics:

* https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/
* https://juliamusic.github.io/JuliaMusic_documentation.jl/dev/

Below is a summary of the various software packages:

### DynamicalBilliards.jl

DynamicalBilliards.jl is an easy-to-use, modular and extendable Julia package for dynamical billiards in two dimensions.


### DynamicalSystems.jl

DynamicalSystems.jl is a Julia software library for the exploration of chaos and nonlinear dynamics.


### InteractiveChaos
Applications to interactively explore chaotic dynamical systems.

### DrWatson
A software package created to help scientists deal with their simulations!


### MusicManipulations.jl

The MusicManipulations.jl package has advanced functionality about note processing, data extraction, quantizing and other similar processes that related to music data.


### MotifSequenceGenerator.jl

MotifSequenceGenerator.jl is a very simple module that does a very simple thing: based on a pool of motifs with specified lengths, it makes a random sequence out of them so that the sequence also has a specified length!

### MIDI.jl

Software for reading and writing MIDI data with Julia. Also offers specialized structures for music notes.
