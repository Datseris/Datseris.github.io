I am the lead developer of two software organizations: [JuliaDynamics](https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/) and [JuliaMusic](https://juliamusic.github.io/JuliaMusic_documentation.jl/dev/). All software that I list below are contained in these two organizations (while other smaller software I have developed can be found on my personal GitHub page).

* DynamicalBilliards.jl: an easy-to-use, modular and extendable Julia package for dynamical billiards in two dimensions.
* DynamicalSystems.jl: an award-winning Julia software library for the exploration of chaos and nonlinear dynamics.
* InteractiveChaos: Applications to interactively explore chaotic dynamical systems.
* DrWatson: A software package created to help scientists deal with their simulations!
* Agents.jl: Flexible, future-full but easy to use Agent-based-modelling framework for Julia.
* MIDI.jl: Software for reading and writing MIDI data with Julia. Also offers specialized structures for music notes.
* MusicManipulations.jl: advanced functionality about note processing, data extraction, quantizing and other similar processes that related to music data.
