Hello and welcome to my webpage!

My name is George Datseris. I am a theoretical physicist and a nonlinear dynamicist. This means that I am interested in understanding parts of the world traditionally classified as "physics", while I try to do that using methods from nonlinear dynamics and chaos. I did my PhD (finished October 2019) in the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, and I am now working as a postdoc in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.

My (main) area of research now is conceptual and fundamental understanding of planetary energy balance, but more details are provided in "Research".

In my free time I do software development, my main goal being high quality scientific software. You can check me out on GitHub, or see "Software" for the things I have developed so far.

My main hobby is playing the drums, checkout ["Music"](/music) to get an idea! I also paint, although I'm not that good there. I upload my paintings on [another webpage](https://www.facebook.com/DatsasSPA/).
