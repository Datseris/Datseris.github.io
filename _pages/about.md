Hello and welcome to my webpage! My name is George Datseris. I am a theoretical physicist and a nonlinear dynamicist. This means that I am interested in understanding parts of the world traditionally classified as "physics", while I try to do that using methods from nonlinear dynamics and chaos. I did my PhD (finished October 2019) in the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, and I am now working as a postdoc in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.

I love playing the drums and painting. In my free time I do software development, my main goal being high quality scientific software. Check me out on GitHub!
