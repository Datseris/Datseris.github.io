Hello and welcome to my website! I am currently working in the University of Exeter as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow.

I am an applied physicist with a broad interest in **nonlinear dynamics and complex systems** and their application to understand the physical world at a conceptual level. My scientific interests are summarized in [Research Interests](/research), and current main focus in my research is understanding the interaction of clouds, climate variability, and climate multistability. Besides research, I am the lead developer of the JuliaDynamics software organization (see [software](/software)), an advocate of open source code and good scientific code practices in academia.
You can find more about my career path by downloading my [CV](/cv).

I am passionate about teaching and education and my teaching style and material I develop are routinely celebrated as exceptional. I approach teaching applied physics and mathematics with a fresh, hands-on computational style. I also develop [workshops](/workshops) for various aspects of computational research and research practices. **If you want to discuss me performing a workshop for your consortium please reach out to me via email**.

I am always interested in **supervising thesis projects for BSc, MSc, or even PhD level** (by co-authoring a funding proposal for PhD).
I have several projects ideas already outlined, some specialized in climate, some in nonlinear dynamics, and some in other topics likes music or computer science.
I am also interested in collaborating with the potential student to develop a new project that best fits their particular interests, provided it also aligns with some of my research interests as well. Feel free to contact me for potential supervision!

My hobbies are [playing the drums](/music), bouldering, [painting](https://www.facebook.com/DatsasSPA/), and videogames, boardgames, billiards.
