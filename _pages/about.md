Hello and welcome to my website! I am currently working in the University of Exeter as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow.
From October 2025 I will be starting as a permanent member of staff in Exeter. You can find more about my career path by downloading my [CV](/cv).

I am an applied physicist with a broad interest in **nonlinear dynamics and complex systems** and their application to understand the physical world at a conceptual level. My scientific interests are summarized in [Research Interests](/research), and current main focus in my research is understanding the interaction of clouds, climate variability, and climate multistability. 

In parallel to research I have been heavily involved in computational software and simulation frameworks throughout my career (see [software](/software)).
Through this I have gained valuable experience on designing research-oriented software so that it is modular, extendable, accessible, and performant. Software I've been involved with routinely outclass competing alternatives and stand out as best-in-class (e.g., [1](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl/blob/main/README.md),[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05011),[3](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/ABMFrameworksComparison)). I am happy to share this knowledge with others implementing computational software or simulation frameworks, reach out to me via email if you'd like consultancy.

I am passionate about teaching and education and my teaching style and material I develop are routinely celebrated as exceptional. I approach teaching applied physics and mathematics with a fresh, hands-on computational style. Beyond academia, I develop [workshops](/workshops) for various aspects of computational research and research practices. A major focus of these workshops is to promote good practices in computational research: open, reproducible, accessible, and more. If you want to discuss me performing a workshop for your consortium please reach out to me via email.

I am always interested in **supervising thesis projects for BSc, MSc, or even PhD level** (by co-authoring a funding proposal for PhD).
I have several projects ideas already outlined, some specialized in climate, some in nonlinear dynamics, and some in other topics likes music or computer science.
I am also interested in collaborating with the potential student to develop a new project that best fits their particular interests, provided it also aligns with some of my research interests as well. Feel free to contact me for potential supervision!

My hobbies are [playing the drums](/music), bouldering, [painting](https://www.facebook.com/DatsasSPA/), and videogames, boardgames, billiards.
