Hello and welcome to my webpage!

My name is George Datseris. I am a theoretical physicist and a nonlinear dynamicist. This means that I am interested in understanding parts of the world traditionally classified as "physics", while I try to do that using methods from nonlinear dynamics and chaos. I did my PhD (finished October 2019) in the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, and I am now working as a postdoc in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.

My scientific interests are summarized in [Research Interests](/research). Partly as my job, but also on my free time, I do software development, my main goal being high quality scientific software. You can check me out on GitHub, or see [Software](/software) for the things I have developed so far.

My hobbies are playing the drums, bouldering, painting, and any sorts of games (board, video, billiards), Checkout [Music](/music) to have a look at some live music of mine.
