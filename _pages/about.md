Hello and welcome to my webpage! My name is George Datseris. I did my PhD (finished October 2019) in the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, and I am now working as a postdoc in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.

Most of my research is on physics: electron transport, nonlinear dynamics and chaos, climate physics. I also work on music timeseries analysis. 

I love playing the drums and painting. In my free time I do software development, my main goal being high quality scientific software. Check me out on GitHub!
