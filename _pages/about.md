Hello and welcome to my webpage!

My name is George Datseris. I am a theoretical physicist and a nonlinear dynamicist. This means that I am interested in understanding parts of the world traditionally classified as "physics", while I try to do that using methods from nonlinear dynamics and chaos. I did my PhD (finished October 2019) in the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization on electron transport in nanodevices. Then I changed fields into climate science, as I did a postdoc on global cloudiness in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. Now I am a Royal Society International Newton Fellow, and after that a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow, at the University of Exeter.

My scientific interests are summarized in [Research Interests](/research). Partly as my job, but also on my free time, I do software development, my main goal being high quality scientific software. You can check me out on GitHub, or see [Software](/software) for the things I have developed so far.

My hobbies are [playing the drums](/music), bouldering, [painting](https://www.facebook.com/DatsasSPA/), and playing games in general: videogames, boardgames, billiards.
