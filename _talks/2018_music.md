This talk had two parts: the first was presenting the paper (Sogorski, Geisel and Priesemann,  PLoS One 13 (1), 2018
) of our "music research group" in the MPIDS. I only participated briefly in this project.

The second part of the talk was introducing my own research project about the impact of micro-timing deviations in human perception, and the statistical properties of such deviations.
